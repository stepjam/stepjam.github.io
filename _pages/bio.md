Dr. Stephen James leads the Dyson Robot Learning Lab in London, UK. Stephen's research interests lie in developing intelligent robots that learn practical skills and behaviours in challenging household environments. To that end, his work has broadly been concerned with sample-efficient reinforcement learning and imitation learning algorithms, unsupervised representation learning, few-shot adaptation, and simulation-to-reality transfer.

Prior to founding the Dyson Robot Learning lab, Stephen was a postdoctoral fellow at UC Berkeley working with Prof. Pieter Abbeel, and prior to that, completed both his PhD and Master's degree at Imperial College London, under the supervision of Prof. Andrew Davison. His research has been recognized through various awards and orals at conferences such as CVPR and CoRL.

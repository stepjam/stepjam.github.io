I was previously the principal investigator of the Robot Learning Lab in London, UK, where I lead a large concentration of the top Robot Learning talent in the world. My interests lie in investigating how to get robots to learn practical skills and behaviours in a data-driven manner, without explicitly needing to hard-code steps for each new task. My work lies on the intersection of reinforcement learning, imitation learning, and unsupervised representation learning.
Previously, I was a postdoctoral fellow at UC Berkeley, advised by Pieter Abbeel, and prior to that, I completed my PhD at Imperial College London, under the supervision of Andrew Davison. I serve as area chair for NeurIPS, CVPR, ICML, and ICLR. For a formal bio, please <a href="/bio">see here</a>.


I am CEO & Founder of Neuracore, a robot learning cloud ecosystem and community, and Assistant Professor at Imperial College London, where I lead the Safe Whole-body Intelligent Robotics Lab (SWIRL). Our lab pushes the boundaries of robot learning by developing safe, intelligent systems that leverage their entire physical embodiment. We operate at the exciting intersection of online reinforcement learning, offline reinforcement learning, and imitation learning, with a relentless focus on sample efficiency and safety. Our vision is simple yet ambitious: create robots that learn efficiently, act intelligently, and operate safely in complex, dynamic environments alongside humans.

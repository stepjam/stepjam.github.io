I was previously the principal investigator of the Robot Learning Lab in London, UK, where I lead a large concentration of the top Robot Learning talent in the world. My interests lie in investigating how to get robots to learn practical skills and behaviours in a data-driven manner, without explicitly needing to hard-code steps for each new task. My work lies on the intersection of reinforcement learning, imitation learning, and unsupervised representation learning.
Previously, I was a postdoctoral fellow at UC Berkeley, advised by Pieter Abbeel, and prior to that, I completed my PhD at Imperial College London, under the supervision of Andrew Davison. I serve as area chair for NeurIPS, CVPR, ICML, and ICLR. For a formal bio, please <a href="/bio">see here</a>.

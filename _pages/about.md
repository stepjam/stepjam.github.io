I am CEO & Founder of Neuracore, a robot learning cloud ecosystem and community, and Assistant Professor at Imperial College London, where I lead the Safe Whole-body Intelligent Robotics Lab (<a href="https://swirl.uk">SWIRL</a>). Our lab pushes the boundaries of robot learning by developing safe, intelligent systems that leverage their entire physical embodiment. We operate at the intersection of online reinforcement learning, offline reinforcement learning, and imitation learning, with a relentless focus on sample efficiency and safety.

Previously, I was the principal investigator of the Dyson Robot Learning Lab in London, UK, where I led a large concentration of the top robot learning talent in the world. Prior to that, I was a postdoctoral fellow at UC Berkeley, advised by Pieter Abbeel, and completed my PhD at Imperial College London, under the supervision of Andrew Davison. I am Associate Editor of IEEE RAL and ICRA, and serve as Area Chair of NeurIPS, CVPR, ICML, ICLR,. and TMLR. For a formal bio, please <a href="/bio">see here</a>.

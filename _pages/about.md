I lead the Dyson Robot Learning Lab in London, UK. Our lab investigates how to get robots to learn practical skills and behaviours in a data-driven manner, without explicitly needing to hard-code steps for each new task. Our work lies on the intersection of reinforcement learning, imitation learning, and unsupervised representation learning.
Previously, I was a postdoctoral fellow at UC Berkeley, advised by Pieter Abbeel, and prior to that, I completed my PhD at Imperial College London, under the supervision of Andrew Davison. For a formal bio, please see bio page.

Prospective candidates for the lab, please see <a href="https://careers.dyson.com/en-gb/search-results/?q=Robot%20Learning%20Lab&page=1&minpage=1&maxpage=1&sort=Score">available roles here</a>.
